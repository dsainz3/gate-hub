# Hypermodern Learning

The GateHub project adopts hypermodern Python practices to keep the
configuration maintainable and reproducible. Key takeaways from this build
out include:

- **Automated formatting** via [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) ensures
  a uniform style with a 79 character line length.
- **Static analysis** through [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) catches
  common errors and enforces the same 79 character limit.
- **YAML linting** keeps Home Assistant configuration files readable and
  consistent.
- **Pre-commit hooks** run these checks automatically, preventing
  non‑conformant code from being committed.

These tools work together to exemplify the hypermodern process: small,
automated feedback loops that encourage clean, well‑documented code.
