# Home Assistant Optimization Plan â€“ gate-hub

This document outlines the current repository strengths, identified optimization opportunities, and a step-by-step plan to implement improvements.
It is designed to serve as a **living document** in your repo (`HA_Optimization_Plan.md`) and will guide you through changes, GitHub workflow, and Home Assistant updates.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Current Repo Strengths

### Organization
- **Modular structure** â€“ using `packages/` for feature-specific configs (e.g., the Football Team automation bundle).
- **File separation** â€“ clear split of `automations.yaml`, `scripts.yaml`, `sensor.yaml`, dashboards, etc.
- **Documentation** â€“ `README.md` is structured and easy to follow.
- **Version control** â€“ proper Git workflow with CI/CD.

### Code Quality
- **Pre-commit hooks** â€“ `ruff`, `prettier`, `yamllint`, plus helpers for whitespace and HA config checks.
- **CI pipeline** â€“ YAML config validation + pre-commit.
- **Custom components** â€“ documented integrations (BLE monitor, Govee, etc.).

### Advanced Features
- **Custom dashboards** â€“ multiple specialised dashboards (Football Team HQ, LED test lab, etc.).
- **Template sensors** â€“ advanced templating for game status/countdowns.
- **Complex automations** â€“ Football Team game-day automations with proper state handling.

## ðŸŽ¯ Priority Optimization Recommendations

| Priority | Impact | Effort | Items |
|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| **P0**   | High   | Low    | Database optimization, Logger config |
| **P1**   | High   | Medium | System monitoring, MQTT enhancement |
| **P2**   | Medium | Low    | Backup automation, Secrets structure |
| **P3**   | Medium | Medium | Zigbee2MQTT tuning, Template organization |
| **P4**   | Low    | Medium | System Performance dashboard, Football Team fade optimisation |

## ðŸªµ Branching Strategy

We will use **Trunk-based Development** with **short-lived topic branches**.
Each PR will be small, focused, and deleted after merge.

**Branch list:**
- `chore/recorder-opts` (P0)
- `chore/logger-opts` (P0)
- `feat/system-monitoring` (P1)
- `feat/mqtt-enh` (P1)
- `chore/backup-automation` (P2)
- `chore/secrets-structure` (P2)
- `feat/zigbee2mqtt-tuning` (P3)
- `chore/templates-split` (P3)
- `feat/perf-dashboard` (P4)
- `feat/football-team-optimizations` (P4)

## ðŸ¤– GitHub CI/CD Plan

### Current Workflows
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** runs two jobs:
  - **`ruff`** installs Python 3.11 with pip caching enabled, restores a dedicated Ruff cache, installs Ruff via pip, and runs both `ruff check` and `ruff format --check` against the repository.
  - **`precommit`** also uses Python 3.11 with pip caching and a pre-commit cache, installs `pre-commit`, skips Ruff hooks (handled earlier), and executes the remaining hooks for YAML formatting, whitespace hygiene, and the Home Assistant config check wrapper.
- **`.github/workflows/ha-config-check.yaml`** focuses on validating the Home Assistant configuration: it checks out the repository, sets up Python 3.11 with pip caching, installs `homeassistant` and `pytest`, prepares a temporary `secrets.yaml` from `.ci/fakesecrets.yaml`, runs `hass --script check_config`, optionally executes pytest-based integration checks, uploads log artifacts, and cleans up generated files.

P2 â€“ Secrets Hygiene
- Keep `.ci/fakesecrets.yaml` aligned with the keys required by CI and local development.
- Store real secrets only in `secrets.yaml` on your Home Assistant host; avoid adding template files to version control.

P3 â€“ Template Organization
- Review `templates.yaml` and determine whether high-traffic sensors (e.g., Football Team game countdown) should move into dedicated include files.
- If you adopt `!include_dir_merge_list` patterns, create the backing directories as part of the same change so CI and runtime both load the templates correctly.
P4 â€“ Performance Dashboard
- Add a dedicated "System Performance" view under `ui-lovelace/` (create the file if it does not exist) highlighting CPU, memory, uptime, and disk usage from the sensors added in P1.
- Combine gauges, history graphs, and entity cards to track trends and expose key metrics at a glance.
